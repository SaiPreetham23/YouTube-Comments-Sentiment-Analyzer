# YouTube-Commests-Sentiment-Analyser
In the digital age, social media platforms like YouTube have become significant forums for public discourse and feedback. The YouTube Comments Sentiment Analyzer aims to automate the  extraction and analysis of sentiments expressed in user comments, providing valuable insights into viewer opinions and  engagement.

This project leverages Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques and Machine Learning Algorithms to analyse YouTube 
comments. Using the VADER (Valence Aware Dictionary and sEntiment Reasoner) sentiment analysis tool from the NLTK 
(Natural Language Toolkit) library, the analyser classifies comments into positive, negative, or neutral categories based on 
their textual content. The preprocessing pipeline involves converting text to lowercase, removing punctuation, special 
characters, stopwords, and applying lemmatization to normalize the text.
